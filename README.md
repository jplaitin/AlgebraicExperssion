# AlgebraicExperssion
Exercise / Mobile Developer  
Write the program specified below. Write tests. Send the whole package to us with  detailed instructions for compilation and running. 
If you need some clarifications  with respect to the exercise, do not send us questions. Make an assumption, and  send the 
list of assumptions made together with your solution. Input  String containing an algebraic expression consisting of lowercase letters 
a, b, ..., z,  parentheses (, ), and operations +, -, *, /, ^. (The operation ^ is exponentiation,  not xor.) 

The length of input string is limited by 1000.  Example input: ((a+b)*(b^c+(d-e)/a))^(c+d/e)  Expected output  
The maximum value of the expression which can be achieved by substituting  numbers 0 or 1 for variables 
(only substitutions which lead to a valid expression are  allowed, i.e. you should not consider e=0 for the example above).  
Example output for example input: 4.0.  You are allowed to produce error messages instead of an answer if by some reason  
task is unsolvable for the given input.  
Things to pay attention to:  
  - The task is harder than you thought initially. You probably will not be able to  produce a program which 
  satisfies requirements completely.  
  - The program should never crash; not even in the case of malformed input.  
  - Documentation. Document how to run your program, document your code,  document known problems.  
  - Clear architecture. Do not write spaghetti code.  
  - Tests and test coverage.
